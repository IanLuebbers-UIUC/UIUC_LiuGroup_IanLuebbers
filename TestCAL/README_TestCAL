~~~~TestCAL~~~~
Simulation to produce calibration gamma spectra on germanium detectors

The purpose of this simulaiton is to confirm that the physics lists are working correctly. This is used as a basis for my other simulations.

This simulation was built off of the rdecay01 example. Credit goes to the Geant4 team for providing this example for public use.

Create this simulation as you would for the rdecay01 example (e.g. make build folder and use cmake).


~~~~Files Included~~~~
AllIsotopes.mac - Macro to run Co60, Cs137, and Na22 point sources
CMakeLists.txt - CMake list to build example
GNUmakefile - [Not sure of use, was in rdecay01 example]
History - Development progress of rdecay01 example
README_TestCAL - This file
README_rdecay01 - README file for rdecay01 example
UserData - [Not sure of use, was in rdecay01 example]
debug.mac - debug macro provided by rdecay01 example
include - header files, all but two of which are included in rdecay01 example. My files I included are:
	StepMax.hh - Step size header file provided by Jin Choi, used to attempt to fix the e+e- annihilation problem in Na22
	stepping.hh - Stepping file used to track energy deposition in the germanium detector
old_macros - macros I used to both debug the simulaiton and macros provided by the rdecay01 example
plotHisto.C - old ROOT analysis file provided by the rdecay01 example
rdecay01.cc - main file to run the simulation
rdecay01.in - [Not sure of use, was in rdecay01 example]
rdecay01.out - [Not sure of use, was in rdecay01 example]
references - macros involving specific decays provided by the rdecay01 example
rootFiles - ROOT files that are generated from this simulation
	AllIsotopeAnalysis.C - analysis script I used to generate the histograms of the gamma spectra
src - source files for this example, all but two are provided by the rdecay01 example
	Both StepMax.cc and stepping.cc correspond to their respective header files
vis.mac - visualization macro used to generate the GUI for this simulation, same as the one provided by the rdecay01 example


~~~~Important Notes~~~~
To change the dimensions of the germanium detectors, edit the values of zLength and diameter G4doubles in include/DetectorConstruction.hh

There is an incident counter variable which is supposed to track incident gammas, but it does not work as intended. Furhter debugging is needed in order to get accurate counts.

I tried to get a folder system to work, which takes the dimensions of the germanium detector and sorts the spectra corresponding to said detector, but I was unable to get it to work. I commented out the lines in my attempt, and the simulation does not sort the ROOT files based on the detector's geometries. These lines of commented code are marked with "BFS" (Broken File System).

include/StepMax.hh and src/StepMax.cc are not implemented in this simulation, so these can be ignored. They can be implemented, if desired.

Beware of overwriting your ROOT files generated in rootFiles/ when changing your detector geometry; I would recommend putting them in a folder specifying your detector dimensions.

In src/DetectorConstruction.cc, there are reminant definitions used to debug the e+e- annihiliation in sodium-22 (this took a long time to figure out in this simulaiton). These can be ignored.

The file generation in src/RunAction.cc is meant for the AllIsotopes.mac macro. If you run the simulation with the GUI, each run you start will be labelled with the calibration source corresponding to the run number specified by AllIsotopes.mac.
